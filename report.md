Write a brief (1-2 pages) evaluation report of your map class: justify any design
decisions (e.g. its interface, the use of friends) and evaluate the support provided by
C++ for developing abstract data types and the use of this support for your map class.
Identify any weaknesses in your implementation and discuss improvements and
alternative representations, and compare your map class with the map class provided in
the STL
